Professor Folk has led the Quantum Devices group since he joined the UBC faculty in 2005. Current topics pursued by the group include the use of entropy measurements as a tool to probe interacting quantum circuits, and the exploration of emergent electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures. More broadly, the group focuses is research on electronic measurements at ultra-low temperatures, in devices that live at the quantum/classical interface: small enough and cold enough that their electronic properties are dominated by novel quantum phenomena, while at the same time able to be fully controlled by experimentally accessible knobs, from gate voltages that define a nanoscale electrostatic potential, to van der Waals stacking arrangements from which engineered 2D materials emerge.
