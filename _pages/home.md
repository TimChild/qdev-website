### About the Lab

The Quantum Devices Group at the University of British Columbia is led by Prof. Joshua Folk. Our group measures the electronic properties of nanometer- and micron-scale devices at temperatures from 0.01K to 1K, where electronic transport is dominated by quantum mechanical effects. Many of our experiments focus on electron spin, because spin is the quantum degree of freedom that is most resilient to environmental decoherence. Projects underway include spin current control and measurement in GaAs circuits, thermopower spectroscopy in quantum point contacts, decoherence and Kondo interactions in quantum dots, graphene nanoelectronics, and thermodynamic probes of the fractional quantum Hall effect. Positions are available for talented and motivated undergraduate and graduate students (please contact Joshua Folk by email for further information).

The Quantum Devices Group is located in rooms 245 and 111 of the Brimacombe Building, on UBC's Vancouver campus.
